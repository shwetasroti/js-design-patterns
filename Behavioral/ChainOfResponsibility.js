/*
	This is a behavioural design pattern that provides a chain of loosely coupled objects. Each of these objects can choose to act on or handle the request of the client.

	A good example of the chain of responsibility pattern is the event bubbling in DOM in which an event propagates through a series of nested DOM elements, one of which may have an "eventlistener" attached to listen and act on the event.
